- ASCII Math: the ASCII code of a given character can be found by subtracting the lower case letter `a` from it. This means we can represent the alphabet in an array:
	- `'z' - 'a' = 25`
	- `'a' - 'a' = 0`

* Hash Map methods
	* Specifically `.getOrDefault()` to provide a value if a key does not exist
