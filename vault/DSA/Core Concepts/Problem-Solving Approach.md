### Understand
1. Read & Understand the Problem
   - Note Constraints / Limitations

2. Verify Inputs / Outputs
   - Consider Time & Space Complexity

3. Clarify Ambiguity / Edge Cases
   - Ask Questions
   
### Plan
1. Break the Problem Down Into Smaller Parts
    - Consider various approaches
    - Think about potential data structures & algorithms that might fit the problem

2. Create a Rough Draft / Pseudocode For The Approach
    - Identify how you will handle various edge cases

### Solve
1. Implement the Solution Using the Plan / Rough Draft

2. Test the solution with various inputs (normal, boundaries, edge cases, etc.)

3. Analyze Performance - [[Asymptotic Analysis|Time & Space Complexity]]

### Review
1. Review & Explain Your Solution
    - Discuss improvements & alternative solutions

2. Optimize & refactor if necessary (i.e., due to follow-up question(s))
