## Overview
Data structures and algorithms is a tremendously important topic within the realm of computer science. But it often only
gets a lot of attention in the context of preparing for interviews within the software space. This sometimes comes across
in debates where there exists a school of thought that working through a coding problem in an interview isn't a real 
representation of what one may actually do in their job. As a result it lets one believe that needing to maintain a 
robust knowledge of the subject is somehow pointless.

I believe it is too easy to take for granted all the abstractions offered to us and completely gloss over the inner 
workings of the technologies we work with on a daily basis. If one abandons curiosity for the sake of expediency in 
everything that they do, it discards the opportunity to grow one's technical and professional skill set.

A lot of tremendously intelligent people have come before us and pioneered the development in how computers organize 
and operate on data. While we might not have to write our own binary search or hash table implementations, it is 
incredibly important and valuable to have a foundational understanding of what these things are and how they work.

This is especially true when it comes to software engineering job interviews. There is no shortage of content tackling 
this topic and strategies for mastering LeetCode style coding problems. However, any worthwhile resource typically 
begins with the recommendation that you have the basics of data structures and algorithms down.

## Purpose
This project began primarily as my own self-study of data structures and algorithms. The motivation behind it was to
create a place where I can deliberately practice and document what I've learned. I felt like just relying on my past
exposure to the subject in university wasn't sufficient, and merely practicing various coding challenges at random
wasn't actually giving me a deeper understanding.

As an added benefit, my hope is that anyone else who may have found themselves in a similar situation of wanting to 
really develop a solid foundation on the topic of data structures & algorithms might find this repository useful.

## DS&A in Practice
This repository attempts to focus on 4 key things:
1. **Foundational Understanding** - What things are & how they work
2. **Hands On Implementation** - Learning by building from the ground up
3. **Generalization / Pattern Recognition** - Breaking things down to their simplest form
4. **Problem-Solving** - Tackling real coding problems
