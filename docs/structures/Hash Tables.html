<h1>Attributes</h1>
<ol>
<li><em>Key-Value Pair Storage</em>: Hash tables store data in pairs of keys and values, where each key is unique.</li>
<li><em>Hash Function</em>: A hash function is used to compute an index (hash code) from the key, determining where the key-value pair should be stored in the table.</li>
<li><em>Collision Handling</em>: Since multiple keys can generate the same hash index, hash tables use techniques like chaining or open addressing to handle collisions.</li>
<li><em>Fast Lookups</em>: Average-case time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions is O(1), due to direct index access provided by the hash function.</li>
<li><em>Dynamic Size</em>: Hash tables resize dynamically (typically doubling the size) when the load factor (number of elements/size of table) crosses a threshold, ensuring efficient space usage.</li>
<li><em>Load Factor</em>: This represents the level of fullness of the hash table and is crucial in deciding when to resize the table.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Operations</h1>
<p>| <strong>Operation</strong>    | <strong>Description</strong>                                          | <strong>Time Complexity</strong> |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| <strong>Insert</strong>       | Adds a key-value pair to the table                        | O(1) average, O(n) worst case |
| <strong>Search</strong>       | Finds the value associated with a given key               | O(1) average, O(n) worst case |
| <strong>Delete</strong>       | Removes a key-value pair from the table                   | O(1) average, O(n) worst case |
| <strong>Update</strong>       | Changes the value of an existing key                      | O(1) average, O(n) worst case |
| <strong>Resize/Rehash</strong>| Increases the table size when the load factor is too high | O(n) when rehashing |
| <strong>Collision Handling</strong> | Handles conflicts caused by multiple keys hashing to the same index | O(1) with effective collision resolution |</p>
<h1>Trade Offs</h1>
<p>| <strong>Pros</strong>                                           | <strong>Cons</strong>                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Average O(1) time complexity for insert, search, and delete | Worst-case time complexity is O(n) due to collisions |
| Efficient memory usage with dynamic resizing       | Requires a good hash function to minimize collisions |
| Supports fast lookups for large datasets           | Resizing and rehashing can be expensive (O(n))       |
| Simple to implement for common operations          | Not suitable for ordered data (cannot traverse in order) |
| Useful in various applications like caching, dictionaries | Inefficient for small datasets compared to simpler data structures like arrays or linked lists |
| Flexible storage of diverse types of data (key-value pairs) | Poor memory locality due to potential collisions and chaining |
| No need to maintain sorted data                    | Susceptible to clustering in some probing methods (e.g., linear probing) |</p>
<h1>Common Uses</h1>
<ol>
<li><em>Databases (Indexing)</em>: Hash tables are widely used in databases to index records for fast lookups of data.</li>
<li><em>Caching</em>: Hash tables are used in caches to store frequently accessed data with quick access times (e.g., LRU Cache).</li>
<li><em>Dictionaries/Maps</em>: They are the underlying data structure for implementing associative arrays (dictionaries in Python, HashMap in Java, etc.).</li>
<li><em>Symbol Tables</em>: In compilers or interpreters, hash tables are used to store variable bindings.</li>
<li><em>Routing Tables</em>: Hash tables are used in networking to store and retrieve routes efficiently.</li>
<li><em>Sets</em>: In some programming languages, hash tables are used to implement sets, which support fast membership tests.</li>
<li><em>Counting Frequencies</em>: Hash tables can be used to count occurrences of items, such as words in a document.</li>
